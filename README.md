# portfolio-web
I was trying to create a 3D portfolio web I created my website using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT 
In my body section I have put a video as the background 
Then I went ahead and created a div(container) so that I put pages in that container
Each page has its container(Div) Hence a nested Div I also created two buttons after the container
with pages I used Javascript to activate the buttons to perform their function 
I also used Javascript and gave it a command so that the background video keeps on playing In each container
I inserted a background image And also for the pages with large content
I inserted a scroll bar and styled it in my CSS.
Also the icons in the last page I used boxicons to get the link to the icons.
I also launched my portfolio online
Here is the link
